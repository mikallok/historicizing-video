<h1>Historicizing &lt;video&gt;</h1>
<h2>Moving pictures and MIDI files</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<article><p>I’ve had some time to wade through the research materials I’ve gathered and to begin framing my historicizing of the HTML5 element project. I began my career on the cusp of Web 2.0, and I only mention this because to understand the element, one has to understand why it wasn’t there from the beginning.</p>
  <img class="img-responsive" src="files/hulagirl.gif" alt="Famous dancing girl GIF created by Chuck Poynter">
<p>Initially, it was a lack of bandwidth that prevented video from being a full-fledged member of HTML, and digging up that history took me back to the MIDI audio files and GIF animations that predominated the Web in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It was a bit of a walk down memory lane and a reminder of how quickly things change. When dialup gave way to DSL and cable, real audio and video started to become more present on the Web. This is the period when proprietary plugins proliferated, and I began to understand why it seemed I was forever receiving prompts to download a certain piece of software to watch a certain video.</p>
<p>That all changed in 2005 with the advent of YouTube, which required viewers to have the Adobe Flash Player ed. Within a year, YouTube was logging more than 2 billion video views monthly–a number that has continued to increase exponentially since then. With YouTube, the Adobe Flash plugin quickly became nearly ubiquitous. But, Adobe’s reign would begin winding down with the age of smartphones, and Apple’s decision not to support the Flash Player plugin on its smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>As the rift between Apple and Adobe started gaining media attention, Steve Jobs addressed Apple’s decision not to support Flash in a now famous (at least among Web historians) speech in April of 2010. He listed security concerns, the proprietary nature of the software, its continued incompatibility with touchscreens, its energy-draining reliance on external software, and the way it limited innovation as reasons for the company’s decision.</p></article>

<article><p>The first animation came to the web via the graphics interchange format or GIF&mdash;pronounced ‘Jif,' according to Steve Wilhite who helped develop the format for CompuServe in 1987. Later that year, CompuServe released an enhanced version of the GIF format that allowed for the creation of compressed animations using time delays (Alfonso, 2012).</p>
  <img class="img-responsive" src="files/hulagirl.gif" alt="Famous hula girl GIF created by Chuck Poynter">
<p>The GIF format remained proprietary until CompuServe was acquired in 1998 by AOL. The internet service provider allowed the GIF patents to expire, and in the public domain, tech-savvy artists like Olia Lialina began experimenting with animation (Alfonso, 2012). Her first web-art series “My Boyfriend came back from the war” incorporated GIFs. Lialina is considered a historian on the use of the format. She lists Chuck Poynter as an interesting and influential GIF artist. Poynter, after retiring from the Air Force, began creating GIFs in the late 1990s. He continued until his death in 2001, leaving behind a large library of animated illustrations, including “Dancing Girl,” which is considered a classic of the 1990s GIF era.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, GIFs began being used as an adornment to websites, providing banners that glittered or provided some other motion, according to Lialina. At the same time, badwidth was increasing, and those tinny sounding Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) tunes GIF animations were replaced by real audio and video.</p>

<h2>Battle of the plugins</h2>
<article>
<p>When dialup gave way to DSL and cable, real audio and video started to become more present on the Web. This is the period when proprietary plugins proliferated, and I began to understand why it seemed I was forever receiving prompts to download a certain piece of software to watch a certain video.</p>
<p>Proprietary software plugins, such as Microsoft Silverlight, Windows Media Player, QuickTime Player, and Adobe Flash Player were required to view video, and these “players battled it out until one emerged as the victor in 2005: Adobe Flash” (Bruce Lawson, 2010).</p>
<p>As the rift between Apple and Adobe started gaining media attention, Steve Jobs addressed Apple’s decision not to support Flash in a now famous (at least among Web historians) speech in April of 2010. He listed security concerns, the proprietary nature of the software, its continued incompatibility with touchscreens, its energy-draining reliance on external software, and the way it limited innovation as reasons for the company’s decision.</p>
<p>YouTube and other video sharing sites quickly looked for open-source alternatives for video playback. Today most of these sites use HTML5 video, but it wasn’t a smooth transition. YouTube launched a beta HTML5 video playback in 2010, and things get a little complicated here. I still have some research to do on how the different video codecs and browsers presented challenges for many sites to quickly pivot to HTML5. I’m still lacking resources in this area of research, so if any of you have a resource that offers a good explanation of codecs in particular, please let me know.</p>

<p>Looking back at the first YouTube video “Me at the zoo,” it’s interesting to see how sophisticated and polished video has become in such a short amount of time. Alongside the history of video on the Web from GIFS to YouTube to the HTML5 tag, I hope to also touch on the evolution of authoring tools that have allowed almost everyone to produce, edit, and publish high-quality videos.</p>

<p>Going into this project, I knew about the conflict between Apple and Adobe. What I didn’t know is that there is a large group of Flash-based animators and video-game designers who see Flash as a powerful tool that allows them to create sophisticated art and interactive experiences without knowing much code. I’m not a gamer, so I wasn’t aware of any of this, but there is resentment among this group of Flash users for being forced to give up what they see as an effective technology. Flash will become totally unsupported in 2020, and the animators and game designers who have become so fluent in Flash will need to find new ways to create content.</p>
